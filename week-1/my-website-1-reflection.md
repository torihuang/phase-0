### How to create a repository on GitHub and clone to your local computer

We are going to create a repository (repo) and clone it to your local computer! First, go to your GitHub account. In the upper right hand corner, you'll see a plus button next to your photo. Click that button, then select "New repository".

This will take you to a repository creation screen. Fill in the requested info for your repo, particularly a memorable name (GitHub usually offers a suggestion if you can't think of one), a short description, select whether you'd like to make your code public or private, and you probably want to initialize your repository with a README. Finally, if you don't mind sharing your code with the world, just select an "MIT License" and click "Create repository".

Congratulations! You have your first repo! You should automatically be taken to this new repository. If not, navigate to the repository. Once there, you will find a url to this new repo! It should be either above your list of files, or off to the right. Copy and paste this link. It will probably be something like: https://github.com/[UserName]/[repository]

Now you'll want to go in to your terminal. If you're not sure what a terminal is, or how to use it, google "How to use terminal to navigate to a folder" and find a useful article. This should bring you up to speed. Navigate to the folder where you wish to deposit this repo. Simply type in "git clone [Paste repo URL here]" and press enter!

You have now created a repository on GitHub, and cloned it to your local computer.

### What is open source and what do I think about it

Open source means providing knowledge for free, for the world to share. Having free, accessible open source code has given people the ability to produce cool new tech more quickly. Startups can use free software to build with little initial capital. Universities can collaborate between each other more easily. Anyone can learn how to do things by accessing huge knowedge databases online.

How I felt about open source when I first learned about it:

After some initial contemplation, being a little wary that open source meant 'anyone can take your stuff', I realized open source is actually awesome! If the world was open source, if we didn't require patents or licensing and all information was free, the world would be an even more awesome place. Unfortunately, for this utopia to be possible, every person with access to this information would have to be motivated by learning and curiosity instead of greed. I am not sure that's possible, but the open source community sure it a great step towards that dream world!

### The importance of using a license

Since the dream world mentioned before, where every person values knowledge over greed, is not currently realistic, it is VERY important to utilize the correct license. Using a license gives you full control over how your code is used. Do you want to ensure anything you make is free, forever, to anyone else who wants to use it? Look in to a GPL. Don't care what happens to your code, so long as you get credit for your work? An MIT License is right for you. Did you create something super awesome and want to protect your right to select whom to whare it with? Maybe you should go with an Apache License.

Without a license, you are basically throwing your code out to anyone and everyone. Anybody could take credit for your work. Even if you really do not care what happens to your code, at least use an MIT License so you get some credit!

### Concepts solidified in this challenge

This challenge helped me form my knowledge of licensing and GitHub. Originally, I was unsure how you could have any form of ownership for your work in an open source community. This challenge helped me understand how licensing works. In terms of GitHub, I had been wondering how you actually connect GitHub to your website. I am starting to understand just how you can use GitHub in a more practical context.

I did not really struggle with this challenge. It was fun though!

### Additional resources for this challenge

This link can be found on the GitHub "New repository" page, and it was very useful to me in understanding licenses.
