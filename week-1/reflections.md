# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

With only 18 weeks to become a junior developer, it will be an interesting balance working to stay creative during a period of such intense learning. Personally, when put in a stressful situation, I tend to become overly anxious. It becomes more difficult for me to focus or relax. This is why I focused on meditation and "the flow" for this assignment.

I currently manage my time by creating prioritized lists, and completing the top to-dos on those lists come hell or high water. This is a great strategy for short to medium term accomplishments, but it can be incredibly difficult on morale after an extended period. This is where I will employ meditation. Meditation, refocusing my mind on something specific like breathing, between these tasks will help me reset my mind and creativity. Understanding more about how to get myself to peak performance, or the flow, will help make my typical sprints even more productive. The "Time Boxing" method will be very useful for this strategy. "Time Boxing", or working for a period of time then reviewing the work completed during that time, will help me focus more on the process than the end goal. The combination of "Time Boxing" with meditation and creating ideal conditions for "the flow" combine to create a time management plan that I hope will help me become an awesome developer during Phase 0!

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection



#1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

Forking a repository copies an existing repository in to your own GitHub account. This is a much better method than creating a new repository and then copying a fellow developers work, for two reasons. First, this copy method may actually count as stealing, depending on the developer's license. At best, it would be a pretty shady thing to do. More practically, forking and cloning is a much faster process! If you had to create a new repository every time you wanted to copy someone else's code, you would have to create each individual folder, file, etc. That would mean time consuming work that would likely result in a few mistakes.It is much easier to simply fork a repository in to your own account!

Here are some basic instructions for how to fork a repository.

1. Navigate to the repository you want to fork on GitHub (github.com)
2. Click "Fork" in the upper right hand corner
3. This should lead you back to your own account, with your forked repository. You now have the repository in your GitHub account!
4. Find the text box with your newly forked repository's html, and copy
5. Open your terminal, and navigate to the directory where you wish to clone this repository
6. Enter "git clone <html here>"
7. You now have the repository on your computer!

If instead of forking a cloning a repo, you simply wish to create your own, follow the instructions below.

1. Navigate to your GitHub account (github.com)
2. In the upper right hand corner, next to your profile picture, click the "+" button
3. Select "New repository" from the drop down menu
4. Enter the requested information. If you are not sure which license to select, the following website can be very helpful! http://choosealicense.com/ (Links to an external site.)
5. Click "Create Repository"
6. You now have a new repository on your GitHub account!

While I was lucky not to encounter any struggles while setting up GitHub, I did learn more about the developer community through this assignment. In particular, getting started on such an open platform where developers around the globe can share their work has given me an improved sense of how open and cooperative this community strives to be. Through this assignment, I have also had the opportunity to practice my command line skills.
