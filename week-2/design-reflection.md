## What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

1. **Information Gathering** - Ask yourself why you are making this website. Things to consider include the purpose, goals, target audience, and content.
2. **Planning** - Use the information from Phase 1 to create a design and implementation plan.
3. **Design** - Now that you have the key content/map of the website, design the site to look and feel amazing for the user. Think about how they will be using, and who will be using it.
4. **Development** - All the parts are in place, time to actually build!
5. **Testing and Delivery** - It is highly likely that something is wrong, which is why the testing phase is so important. Delivery and testing go hand in hand, as in some cases you may be testing your product as it is used by customers. With more users, you are bound to find bugs and improvements.
6. **Maintenance** - Technology gets old and people will find bugs. Now you need to maintain your site.

## What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary purpose of my site is to find a kick ass job, preferably with a small company or a startup. In order to find said job, my site will primarily feature projects I have worked on.

## What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is potential employers. I hope my website conveys spirit, simplicity, adventure, cleverness, and drive.

## What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action the user should take when visiting my site is to first see my project portfolio, and then connect with me via email, github, or linkedin.

## What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

User Experience and design is how companies, individuals, organizations, and basically everyone with a website communicates their message and brand to the world. The main thing to know about design and user experience is that it is incredibly **important**.

The other thing that people should know is that design and user experience is not based on the creator's feelings and whims. Good user experience and design is built on strong data and user testing. It is really quite the analytical process. I think that is pretty neat!

## What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

Imagine your favorite website. Is it easy to use? Is it intuitive? Is it beautiful? Probably. That is a good user experience.

Now imagine your least favorite website. Is it difficult to navigate? Does it make your eyes hurt looking at the comic sans across the screen? That is a bad user experience.

If you were comparing two companies, and they were the owners of these two drastically different websites, which would you be more likely to use? Probably the first. Good user experience brings more customers, and is therefore incredibly valuable.

Not to mention, the user experience is an unspoken way that companies communicate their efficiency, ability, and culture to their customer. That is also very valuable!

## Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I found answering these questions a little tedious. The map was fun though!
