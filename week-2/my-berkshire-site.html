<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site? Both of us have prior experience working with HTML and our initial pre-work was close to identical.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements? Easier than git exercises were.  Information online and in previous courses helped explain all we needed to know to complete exercise.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML). We did fine.  No formating - set up a div to format in CSS later.
- What seems good and bad about HTML? Good at seeing and foreseeing actual content that will be on website. Bad it seems to be incomplete or bland without having CSS paired early on.  Also can be repetitive i.e. <li>
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML? Always having closing tags, using MDN, repetition to memorize.
