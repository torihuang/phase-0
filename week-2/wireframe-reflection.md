###What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is like an initial sketch of what your website will look like. A wireframe can be anything from a drawing on a piece of paper, to a images created digitally, to an interactive (but still nonfunctional) version of your envisioned site.

###What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframing is a great way to put your thoughts to paper. You can see, physically, how your site will look and feel. You can even plan out some of the more practical details (widths, colors, etc.). It is also a great way to share and explain your ideas with your team.

###Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I did enjoy wireframing my site! I wish I could actually create some of my more advanced wireframes. My site would look awesome. Unfortunately, my dreams are currently bigger than my JavaScript skills.

But not for long!

###Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I revised my wireframe a little once I realized that my initial idea would require some serious JavaScript! Guess I'll save that for a few weeks in!

###What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

When creating the wireframe, I was trying to think of the best tools in HTML I could use to create them. I used html5doctor.com to do a little research.

###Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I could not, for the life of me, figure out why my wireframe images were not loading. I spent, no exaggeration, at least an hour on it. I was missing a /. That was pretty tedious, to say the least.
