## How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Chrome's DevTools allows you to play with your CSS without actually making permanent changes. You can temporarily "turn off" an attribute to experiment with various settings, and turn it right back on when you need it! It also shows you the padding, border, margin, etc. of any element in a visual way.

## How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

You can resize elements on the DOM using height and width. In some ways, you can also change the size of elements and their borders by utilizing padding, border, and margin.

## What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Static position is where an element would naturally fall. Relative positioning moves the element *relative* to where it would naturally fall (with static positioning). Fixed positioning is not relative to anything other than your viewport. A fixed positioned object would be placed relative to the viewport, and will even move with your view as you scroll. Absolute positioning tells an element to act very similar to relative positioning, if it has an ancestor that has been positioned, but works like fixed conditioning if it does not have a positioned ancestor.

## What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Padding is the space created inside a given element. It is the distance between the items inside the element, and the wall of the element. Border is like adding an extra line outside the element. That line has a thickness, pattern, and color. Margin is like adding space outside the element. It's like inverse padding.

## What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

This challenge was so so helpful. It really helped my understanding of float vs. position vs. display!
