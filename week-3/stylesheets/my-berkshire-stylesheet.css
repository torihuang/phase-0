What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

It is important to know that the stylesheet was designed specifically with that HTML file in mind.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

It was not too difficult to get the site how we wanted, since the original site has a very clear structure to follow. We looked at each element as a block.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

We used size, color, display, position, text-align, vertical-align, border, font-size, max-width, margin.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

We used classes for elements where CSS could be replicated in another instance. The lines, for example, all require the same CSS. Therefore, we used a class. We used ID for special elements with one-of-a-kind styling, like the photo of Warren Buffett.

We used both classes and id.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

I believe our code was actually cleaner. We followed best practices, and we were able to do so by having a stylesheet.
