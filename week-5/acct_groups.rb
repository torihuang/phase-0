In this challenge, you will make your own method to automatically create accountability groups from a list of names. You'll want to make of the People in your cohort. Try to get everyone into an accountability group of 4 or 5. Be sure everyone is in a group of at least 3 -- It's no fun if someone is in a group by themself or with one other person.

This is a creative challenge and you can make it as easy or difficult as you would like. Decide what an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) will look like and what the output should be. This is part of the challenge.

PSEUDOCODE

Input: Array of Strings (List of names)
Output: Array of Arrays (Accountability groups, 4-5 in a group but at least 3)

In this method, we want to divide up a list of people in to groups of 4 or 5, but at least 3. We want to have at least 10 groups and no more than 20 groups, however it is more important that we have at least three people in a group and no more than 5 people in a group.

First, we will check the ideal number of people per group. We will do this by comparing the group sizes for 5, then 4, then 3 people per group to the conditions listed above. Next, we will check the remainder of people left after dividing the group by the ideal number. If the ideal number picked is five, we will make the last few teams groups of four by taking away from previous groups and adding to the final group. If the ideal number picked is four, we will make the last few teams groups of five. If the ideal number is three, we will make the last few teams groups of four by adding the remainder to current groups.

We will then randomly assign groups by picking someone from the list and filling them in group 1, until group 1 is full from the condition, the group 2, group 3, etc. We will fill the last few groups with the conditions listed above.

Then everyone will have an accountability group!

What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?

The best part of this challenge was the open ended aspect! You could make it as detailed as you wanted. I really enjoyed that. I struggled with creating workable situations for if someone wanted to sort a team of 10 - 16, but I think I figured out a solution!

Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?

The pseudocode is slowly improving. It still needs practice, for sure.

Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?

I believe my approach for automating this task is acceptable. I am positive there are better solutions out there though.

What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?

I decided to use a hash, as it was easiest to declare and fill for what I was trying to do.

What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?

I learned that you should leave a TON of time for refactoring!
