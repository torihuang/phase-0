PERSON 1 - TORI HUANG

As a user, I want three functions that will take my collection of numbers and complete calculations for me. I have two collections of numbers. The first is 3,3,3,4,4,4,6 and the second is 5,5,5,5,6,6,8,8. I've listed the requirements for calculations below:

 - A function called 'sum' that will tell me the total value of my numbers added together.
 - A function called 'mean' that returns the average value of my numbers.
 - A function called 'median' that returns the median value of my numbers.
